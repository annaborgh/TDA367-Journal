# TDA367-Journal

Welcome!

This is the Journal Program, designed and written by Group 8 within the course TDA367 Object-oriented programming project, 
during the first study period in the second year of the Bachelor’s Program in Information Technology given at the Chalmers University of Technology. 

The GUI I simple and the program is supposed to be used as a journal, where you can write entries for each day, as well as being able to rate your day, and add moods and tags to your entries. 
The ratings, moods and tags can be found under the statistics part of the program, and are supposed to give the user an overview of their mood and what affects it the most.

(Please observe that the text below is the instruction that should be used when the script files are working properly, which they at the moment do not. 
You can build the program from the command line, but not actually run it. Therefore, we suggest to run the program from an IDE such as IntelliJ.
Make sure to have the proper configurations and to add JavaFX as a library in the project structure settings before running it.)

There are easy ways to run the program without having to build it from an IDE. The recommended approach is this:

1. Download the code by pressing the green button with the label **”Code”**, and then the option **”Download ZIP”**. 
Put the ZIP document in an appropriate place, and then open up the ZIP by double-clicking on it. 

2. Open the command line on your computer.
2.1. Windows: Press **”Start”**. In the **”Search”** or **”Run”** line, type **”cmd”** and then press **Enter**.
2.2 MacOS: Open Spotlight by pressing ⌘ **Command** + **Space** on your keyboard. Type **”Terminal”** in the search box and double-click **”Terminal”**. 

3. Make sure that you have a Java JDK aswell as Gradle installed.
3.1 Java JDK: Write **”java -version”** in the command line and press **Enter**.
3.2 Gradle: Write **”grade -v”** in the command line and press **Enter**. 
If both of these steps gives you feedback, both are installed. If something is missing, install before proceeding (can also be done through the command line).

4. You now need to know how to find the correct folder before running it. 

An easy way to choose the correct folder when using MacOS, is to simply write the **”cd”** command, and then drag the correct folder into the command line window. 
The correct path will be pasted into the command line after **”cd”** and then you are at the right place. 
If this is not possible, you need to navigate through directories and folders with the **”cd”** command.
The path can look something like **cd /Users/user-name/Desktop/TDA367-Journal-main **

5. When you are at the correct folder, type **”gradle run”** in the command line. When you press **Enter**, the journal program should start.

For questions or other thoughts about the program, please contact Group 8. 

Happy journaling!
